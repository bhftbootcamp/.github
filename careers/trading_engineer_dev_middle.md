The Trading Developers team works on trading infrastructure - data acquisition and processing, data visualization, development and maintenance of back-office systems, optimization algorithms, and reconciliations.

The bootcamp lasts for at least one month. It's not an internship but a full-time paid job.
During the bootcamp (<img align=bottom src=/assets/1_4_months.gif height=12px>), you will be able to perform real business tasks and gain new knowledge.
